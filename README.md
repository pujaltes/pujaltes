### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Things i'm interested in:

- Iâ€™m currently working on topological and geometric data analysis of neural activity.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Algebraic Topology and C.
- Iâ€™m looking for help contribute to more open source projects.

I developed a spike sorting pipeline called TopoSort. It's currently private as we're still working on publishing our results. If you would like to collaborate with us on TopoSort or test out our algorithm, feel free to contact me.

Check out my [website](https://pujaltes.github.io/blog/) to see some of the python apps I've made for my students.
